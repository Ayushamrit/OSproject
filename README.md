1. Project Overview 
 
 Aim 
 The primary thing of this design is to develop a simulator that allows users to understand and visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms operate. By simulating these algorithms, users can gain perception into their performance characteristics, similar as effectiveness and responsiveness. The design aims to produce an educational tool that can be used in academic settings or by individualities interested in computer knowledge concepts. 
 
 Expected conclusions 
	A completely functional operation that allows users to input process details( arrival times, burst times, and priorities). 
	Real- time visualizations of the scheduling process through Gantt charts, which will help users see how processes are executed over time. 
	-computation and display of performance criteria , including average waiting time and average turnaround time, which are critical for assessing the effectiveness of scheduling algorithms. 
 
 range 
 The design will concentrate on four essential CPU scheduling algorithms 
 1. First- Come- First- Serve( FCFS) Processes are executed in the order they arrive. 
 2. Shortest Job First( SJF) The process with the lowest burst time is executed next.
 3. Shortest Remaining Time First(SRTF) The process with smallest remaining time will be executed first
 3. Round Robin( RR) Each process is given a fixed time slice( amount) in a cyclic order. 
 4. Priority Scheduling Processes are executed based on their priority situations. 
 
 The operation will allow users to input multiple processes and visualize the scheduling in real- time. 
 
 
2. Module-Wise Breakdown 
 
 Module 1 User Interface( GUI) 
Purpose This module serves as the frontal end of the operation, allowing users to interact with the simulator. It'll give a user-friendly interface for inputting process details and viewing results. 
jobs 
	Input Collection The GUI'll have fields for users to enter the arrival time, burst time, and priority of each process. 
	Algorithm Selection Users can elect which scheduling algorithm they want to simulate from a dropdown menu. 
	Result Display After running the simulation, the GUI'll display the Gantt map and performance criteria . 
 
 Module 2 CPU Scheduling Algorithms 
- Purpose This module contains the core sense for enforcing the various CPU scheduling algorithms. It'll handle the scheduling logic and computations. 
- jobs 
	Algorithm implementation Each scheduling algorithm will be enforced as a separate function that processes the input data and simulates the scheduling. 
	Performance Metrics computation The module will calculate average waiting time and turnaround time for the processes based on the opted algorithm. 
	Data Preparation for Visualization The scheduling data will be formatted for visualization in the Gantt map. 
 
 Module 3 Data Visualization 
Purpose This module is responsible for visualizing the scheduling process and displaying performance criteria . 
- jobs 
	Gantt Chart Creation Using a library like Matplotlib, this module will produce a Gantt map that visually represents the implementation timeline of the processes. 
	Metrics Display It'll also display the calculated performance criteria ( average waiting time and turnaround time) in a clear and concise manner. 
 
 
 3. Functionalities 
 
 Module 1 User Interface( GUI) 
Input Fields 
	Arrival Time A text field where users can enter the arrival time of a process. 
	Burst Time A text field for entering the burst time( execution time) of the process. 
	Priority A text field for entering the priority status of the process. 
 Dropdown Menu 
	Users can elect the scheduling algorithm they wish to use( FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling). 
 Buttons 
	Add Process A button that allows users to add the entered process details to a list. 
	Run Simulation A button that executes the opted scheduling algorithm and displays the results. 
	Clear A button that resets the input fields and clears the process list. 
 Output Display 
	A section to show the average waiting time and average turnaround time after the simulation is run. 
 
 Module 2 CPU Scheduling Algorithms 
- FCFS Implementation 
order the processes by arrival time and calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. 
- SJF Implementation 
order the processes by burst time for those that have arrived and calculate the waiting and turnaround times. 
-SRTF Implementation
Execute the process based on the process having shortest 
Reaming burst time and calculate the waiting and turnaround times.
-Round Robin Implementation 
Implement time- slicing based on the time amount. Each process gets a fixed time slice, and if it does not finish, it goes back to the end of the line. 
Priority Scheduling Implementation
- order processes by priority and calculate the waiting and turnaround times. high priority processes are executed first. 
 
 Module 3 Data Visualization 
 Gantt Chart Visualization 
 Use Matplotlib to produce a horizontal bar chart that represents the scheduling of processes over time. Each bar will represent a process, and the length of the bar will correspond to the burst time. 
 Performance Metrics Display 
 Show the average waiting time and average turnaround time in a user-friendly format, possibly using markers or text boxes in the GUI. 
 
 
4. Technology Recommendations 
 
Programming Language Python is recommended due to its simplicity and the vacancy of libraries for GUI and data visualization. 
- Libraries 
- Tkinter A built- in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. It's easy to use and well- demonstrated. 
- Matplotlib A important library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It'll be used to produce Gantt charts. 
- NumPy/ Pandas( optional) These libraries can be used for effective data handling and computations, especially if you need to manage larger datasets or perform complex computations. 
- Development Tools 
- An Integrated Development Environment( IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code for writing and debugging code. 
- Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with others if demanded.
